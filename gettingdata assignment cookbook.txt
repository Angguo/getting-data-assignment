Feature Selection 
=================

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each motion pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

The variable indicating the activity labels is:

activity

The variable labeling the subjects from which measurements were collected is:

subject


Each row records average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
